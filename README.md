# LeetCode Java Solutions

A structured collection of my LeetCode solutions in Java. All problems are organized by pattern (arrays, sliding window, two pointers, etc.) to make reviewing and re-practicing easier.

---

## Project Structure

src/leetcode/
│── Main.java
│── arrays/
│── slidingwindow/
│── twopointers/
│── hashmap/
│── binarysearch/
│── stack/
└── (more coming...)

Each problem uses the format:

LC<number>_<ProblemName>.java

Example:
LC424_CharacterReplacement.java
LC567_PermutationInString.java

---

## Running Code

Use Main.java to run sample problems:

System.out.println(LC424_CharacterReplacement.solve("AABABBA", 1));
System.out.println(LC567_PermutationInString.solve("ab", "eidbaooo"));

## Goals

• Build a clean pattern-based reference of solved problems  
• Strengthen Java fundamentals for interview prep  
• Improve recall by grouping problems with the same technique  
• Track long-term progress  

---

## Patterns Covered

• Arrays  
• Hashing  
• Two Pointers  
• Sliding Window  
• Binary Search  
• Stack / Queue  
• Linked List (soon)  
• Trees, Graphs (later)  
• Dynamic Programming (later)

## Roadmap

[ ] Add more categories  
[ ] Add more solved problems  
[ ] Add complexity analysis  
[ ] Add problem explanations  
[ ] Add daily practice tracking
